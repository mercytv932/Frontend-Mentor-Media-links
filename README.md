A personal profile card created with HTML and CSS that presents basic information in a clean, centered layout. The page displays a profile image, name, location, and a short description, followed by a list of social and developer platform links such as LinkedIn, Frontend Mentor, YouTube, Instagram, and GitHub. The design uses a dark theme, rounded elements, and spacing to keep the content organized and visually clear. Hover effects on the links add interaction, while the centered card layout highlights how HTML structure and CSS styling work together to create a focused profile page.
